# WLAN_PHY_PythonModule
-(We will refactor the project as Pytorch tensor project, to see how much GPU can help on our decoding)-
We will build WLAN PHY into Sionna. Tensorflow based simulation. https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/

WLAN_PHY_PythonModule is a framework for 802.11 PHY algorithm development and simulation.
